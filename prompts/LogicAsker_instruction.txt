Solve a question answering task by having a Thought, then Finish with your answer. Thought can reason about the current situation. Finish [answer] returns the answer and
finishes the task. You will be given context that you should use to help you answer the question.
Given the facts and a question, try to define predicates and variables if necessary. Then, parse the problem and the question, formulate them into first-order logic formulas.
Next, try to infer the statement presented in the question based on the premises.
If it is possible to infer the statement, please answer "Yes".
If it is possible to infer the negation of the statement, please answer "No".

In your response, please include a reasoning path to show each step of the inference where you need to specify what logic rule is applied to which premises.
The format of the reasoning step should be like the following:
Thought: {A high-level thought to solve the question}
Action: {The description of an action to realize the thought}
Observation: {After applying the action, what would you get? Can be a new formula}

It is not necessary to have a new thought for each step, but an action and an observation should be in each step.

The grammar of the first-order logic formular is defined as follows:
1) logical conjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ∧ expr2
2) logical disjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ∨ expr2
3) logical exclusive disjunction of expr1 and expr2: expr1 ⊕ expr2
4) logical negation of expr1: ¬expr1
5) expr1 implies expr2: expr1 → expr2
6) expr1 if and only if expr2: expr1 ↔ expr2
7) logical universal quantification: ∀x
8) logical existential quantification: ∃x
